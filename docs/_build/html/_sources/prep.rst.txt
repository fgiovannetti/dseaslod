Prepare your TEI XML edition for transformation
===============================================


TEI allows different ways to encode the same textual features. A trivial example is the possibility to validly mark up a person name using the tags <persName>, <name>, or <rs> (|TEI Guidelines, 13. Names, Dates, People, and Places|).

Despite its important advantages, such a heterogeneity makes it challenging to develop transformation scripts that adapt to any encoding model.
 
On this account, in order to ensure a correct functioning of the transformation script, it is necessary to follow specific encoding guidelines to prepare the input TEI XML document for transformation via LIFT.
